- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @atmosbear
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front end web development using react, svelte, etc; also, all things javascript! This GitHub page is a tiny bit sparse honestly but that's just because I am still working on it! :)
- You'll notice that I have a lot of templates - that's because I love starting with a minimalist fresh start, so for each tool I've learned, I created my own personal minimal template.
- My actual projects that aren't templates are pinned!
