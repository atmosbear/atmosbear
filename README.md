- Hey! Iâ€™m @atmosbear, but my real name is Nate. I'm looking to get hired as a front-end or full stack web developer!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front end web development using react, svelte, etc; also, all things javascript!
- My actual projects that aren't templates are pinned!
- You'll notice that I have a lot of templates - that's because I love starting with a minimalist fresh start, so for each tool I've learned, I created my own personal minimal template.
